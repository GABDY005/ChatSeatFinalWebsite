                    <p>
                        In a bid to tackle social isolation, we would like to establish a series of chats seats acros Australia. The <strong>Chat Seats</strong> initiative aims to provide a safe and inviting place for people to talk. It will allow members of the community to <strong>“Connect through Conversation.”</strong> For this initiative to be successful we need people like yourselves to volunteer to be either Listeners and/or Coordinators.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This website is also open to individuals who may have stopped to chat on one of our Chat Seats. If you are looking for when a particular Listener is scheduled to visit your Chat Seat, please sign in and go to the Calendar and find your venue and Listener.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-4 text-info">Listeners</h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Listeners</strong> are individuals who volunteer their time to sit on a <strong>Chat Seat</strong> and listen to members of the community who may join them. Some of these members of the community may also be lonely and/or isolated. We are hoping to connect them back into their community through conversation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, who would be a great volunteer? Someone who enjoys listening to other people and is interested in what is happening for them. Also, someone who has a couple of hours each week where they would like to sit at one of our Chat Seat locations. Does this sound like you?

                    <p>
                        If you would like to volunteer as a Listener, then you will need to sign in and proceed to the page for Listeners. On this page you will find some helpful information, a booking calendar and a place where you can chat with other Listeners.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Coordinators</strong> are individuals who are also volunteers and may also choose to be Listeners. They will help to establish a site and support the Listeners. So, who would be a good Coordinator? Someone who enjoys negotiating with potential venue “managers” and has good organisational skills.Coordinators are individuals who are also volunteers and may also choose to be Listeners.
