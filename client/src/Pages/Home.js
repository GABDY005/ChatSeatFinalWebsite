            <p>
            In a bid to tackle social isolation, we would like to establish a series of chats seats acros Australia. The <strong>Chat Seats</strong> initiative aims to provide a safe and inviting place for people to talk. It will allow members of the community to <strong>“Connect through Conversation.”</strong> For this initiative to be successful we need people like yourselves to volunteer to be either Listeners and/or Coordinators.
